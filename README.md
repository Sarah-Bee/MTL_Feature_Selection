# MTL_Feature_Selection
An area of PBSHM which has recently been recognised for potential development is the use of multi-task learning (MTL). This repository contains code to recreate similar results to the datasets used in the paper: “Improving Feature Selection within Structural Datasets using Multi-Task Learning”. 

In order to run the code a dataset is required. The ``Gaussian'' dataset can be selected in the datasetLoading file to run a dummy version of the code.
